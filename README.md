# NVIDIA Systems Learning Lab

Educational notes, labs, and a small conceptual simulator for learning how NVIDIA AI systems fit together across `CUDA`, `NVLink`, `NVSwitch`, `NCCL`, `NVSHMEM`, `Blackwell`, `Rubin`, `Vera`, and the public `Feynman` roadmap.

This repo is for learning system architecture, not for reverse engineering unreleased hardware. Where NVIDIA has only published roadmap-level information, this repo says so directly.

## What This Repo Covers

- How the modern NVIDIA stack fits together from chips to collectives
- The difference between compute, scale-up fabric, and scale-out networking
- Public roadmap context for `Blackwell`, `Rubin`, `Vera`, and `Feynman`
- Hands-on labs using public repos such as `cuda-samples` and `nccl-tests`
- A small Python fabric simulator for intuition about topology, bandwidth bottlenecks, and hop count

## What This Repo Does Not Do

- Emulate `Blackwell`, `Rubin`, or `Feynman` at ISA or microarchitecture fidelity
- Reproduce exact private topologies or unpublished interconnect behavior
- Replace official NVIDIA documentation

## Learning Path

1. Read [docs/how-the-stack-fits.md](docs/how-the-stack-fits.md).
2. Read [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
3. Run the simulator:

```bash
python3 -m sim.fabric_sim --preset dual_gpu_nvlink --size-gb 16
python3 -m sim.fabric_sim --preset nvswitch_box --source GPU0 --target GPU7 --size-gb 32
```

4. Work through [labs/first-week.md](labs/first-week.md).
5. Use [labs/contribute.md](labs/contribute.md) to start contributing upstream.

## Repo Layout

- `docs/`: architecture notes and roadmap comparisons
- `labs/`: guided hands-on exercises and contribution ideas
- `sim/`: conceptual topology simulator
- `tests/`: simulator tests

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -U pip pytest ruff
ruff check .
pytest
python3 -m sim.fabric_sim --preset workstation_pcie
```

## Design Principle

Use public facts for the roadmap, use current public software for hands-on learning, and use simple simulation only for intuition.
